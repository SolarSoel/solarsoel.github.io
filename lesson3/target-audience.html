        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>The intended audience is all residents of Kelios and the various villages around. For anyone who wishes to 
            travel between the villages and especially for those wanting to keep track of activities around their village.
        </p>
        <h1>Personas</h1>
        <div class="personas">
            
            <div class="coda">
                 <img src="images/coda.jpeg" alt="Portrait of female with purple hair">
            Coda is frequently outside for her work, keeping an eye out for Shadows and traveling between villages
            to deliver goods. She is often one of the first people on the road and needs to report the conditions for 
            those that will be on the road afterwards. 
            </div>

            <div class="soren">
                <img src="images/soren.jpeg" alt="Portrait of young man"> Soren often frequents the various libraries
            around Kelios. Going between villages without checking the road conditions or if there have been Shadow spottings
            can be dangerous, not to mention the weather. It would be a shame to walk in the rain with a book!

        <h1>Scenarios</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Reyna plans to visit the Marketplace in Kelios. It will take a few days to travel there, so she needs to 
                plan ahead for what kind of weather there might be. She is traveling alone and needs to know where she can
                safely stop for the night.
            </li>
            <li>Lydian is a vigilante hunting down the Shadows that have been attacking the villages. She uses the site to 
                check for recent reports of sightings.
            </li>
            <li>Carson is a village mayor. He is preparing for a local annual celebration. He first checks to see if 
                there have been any Shadow sightings in the surrounding villages and woods, then the weather. He notices that
                a road leading into the village is marked for needing heavy repairs. He organizes a team to prepare the road
                for anyone who is travelling in for the celebration.
            </li>
            <li>Neville is a member of a caravan selling goods. He keeps an eye on the site all throughout the day so 
                he be prepared for the weather that evening. He sees there is a chance for rain, so he goes ahead to set up his
                tent, grabbing an extra blanket for the predicted chill.
            </li>
            <li>Marvin has an appointment in a neighboring village to paint a portrait. Things are going smoothly until he checks
                the site and realizes that the road he planned to take is currently infested with Shadows and in disrepair. He searches
                the map to see if there are any alternative routes.
            </li>
